type Wibble {

}


----- ERROR
error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:3
  │
3 │   public fn wobble() {}
  │   ^^^^^^ I was not expecting this

Found the keyword `public`, expected one of:
- `}`
- a record constructor
Hint: Gleam is not an object oriented programming language so
functions are declared separately from types.
